Experimental Evaluation

o Details of how users approached the use of Google News and our system.
o Put Usability and Effectiveness (currently Section 5.2.3) as the first
sub-section.
o One table which summarizes *all* experiments.
    - Experiment name, metric, no. of users
o Difference between just clustering and clustering and/or context is not
  clear.
    - This needs to be clearly explained in the previous sections, with
    examples.
    - In the experiments section, what is the metric that shows the
    difference between these two? One possibility is to show result sets of just
    clustering and clustering/context and ask the user which they prefer.
* Is the clustered set of articles a subset of clustering/context?
Can we show that adding articles for context *does not* reduce precision.
